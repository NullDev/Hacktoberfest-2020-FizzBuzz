# :exclamation: READ BEFORE CONTRIBUTING
**THIS REPOSITORY IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE HACKTOBERFEST VALUES AND RULES:** <br>
We cannot accept every PR and label invalid one's accordingly! Examples are off-topic contributions, duplicated solutions, copy-paste solutions as well as obvious +1 attempts. <br>
We are searching for **interesting/creative/abstract/unique/extraordinary/weird** solutions to FizzBuzz. Only one _normal_ solution per language is permitted! <br>
This repository aligns with [the values of the Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details) as it is meant as a fun challenge as well as a platform to learn (experiment with different solutions, challenging yourself to come up with creative solutions to a unique problem). <br>
**Denied PR's can be found [here](https://github.com/NLDev/Hacktoberfest-2020-FizzBuzz/issues?q=label%3Ainvalid+is%3Aclosed)**.

## :wrench: Steps to add your solution:

1. [Fork](https://github.com/NLDev/Hacktoberfest-2020-FizzBuzz/fork) this repository.

2. Add your solution to the folder with the name of your language. If there is no folder for your language yet, create one! 

3. Name your file with a fitting description. 

4. Comment the first lines of your file (if possible) like that (use whatever commenting syntax is supported by the language you use!):

```js
// [SHORT DESCRIPTION HERE]
// Author: @YourGitHubUserName

...
```

## :question: What is FizzBuzz?

Quick summary:

> FizzBuzz is a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three it prints “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five, it prints “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five it prints “FizzBuzz”.

## :question: What do you mean by "creative" solutions?

Well, I'm not looking for normal solutions. You know, the ones you'd find in a book or so. I'm looking for something interesting! Whether that's a fancy one-liner in the language of your choice, or perhaps a funny [eso-language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language), or maybe an intentionally weird solution that you don't even quite understand yourself (be sure to document those!). Anyhow, the goal is to have fun and maybe even learn a thing or two. 

If you're still unsure, check out our [top 5 user contributed samples](https://github.com/NLDev/Hacktoberfest-2020-FizzBuzz#trophy-top-5-personal-favorites) :) 

**Happy hacking!**
