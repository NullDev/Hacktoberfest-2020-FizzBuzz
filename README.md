**Note:** <br>
We can't accept every PR and label invalid one's accordingly. Examples are off-topic contributions as well as duplicated solutions. <br>
This repository aligns with [the values of the Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details) as it is a platform to learn (experiment with different solutions, learning how GitHub & PR's work, challanging yourself to come up with creative solutions to a unique problem). Denied PR's can be found [here](https://github.com/NLDev/Hacktoberfest-2020-FizzBuzz/issues?q=label%3Ainvalid+is%3Aclosed).

## :wrench: Steps to add your solution:

1. [Fork](https://github.com/NLDev/Hacktoberfest-2020-FizzBuzz/fork) this repository.

2. Add your solution to the folder with the name of your language. If there is no folder for your language yet, create one! 

3. Name your file with a fitting description. 

4. Comment the first lines of your file (if possible) like that (use whatever commenting syntax is supported by the language you use!):

```js
// [SHORT DESCRIPTION HERE]
// Author: @YourGitHubUserName

...
```

## :question: What is FizzBuzz?

Quick summary:

> FizzBuzz is a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three it prints “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five, it prints “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five it prints “FizzBuzz”.

## :question: What do you mean by "creative" solutions?

Well, I'm not looking for normal solutions. You know, the ones you'd find in a book or so. I'm looking for something interesting! Whether that's a fancy one-liner in the language of your choice, or perhaps a funny [eso-language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language), or maybe an intentionally weird solution that you don't even quite understand yourself (be sure to document those!). Anyhow, the goal is to have fun and maybe even learn a thing or two.

**Happy hacking!**
